Project Service & Project Controller
    2 things: working on service layer, and then working on controller layer
    2 packages: services () and web (where we are going to put controllers)
    why are we going to create a service layer?
        People usually put autowired the repository straight into the controller,
        for simple scenarios that might be for a game.
        However, what that usually does and the problem they usually get into whenever you do this is that
        you end up putting way too much logic in the controller. That's in my opinion not a good practice.
        You always want to hae your logic abstracted from the controller as much as you can obviously.
        And then tou only pretty much just want the controller to be a router rather than a place that
        holds your logic.
        So this is why I want to always use a service layer that talks to the repository rather than having
        a bunch of logic on the controller layer.
